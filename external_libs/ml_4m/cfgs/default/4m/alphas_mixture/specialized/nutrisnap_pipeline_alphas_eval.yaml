# Alphas configuration for NutriSnap EVALUATION pipeline:
# Goal: Evaluate full pipeline generation from tok_rgb@224.
# Input: tok_rgb@224
# Output: tok_depth@224 -> tok_semseg_n5k@224 -> caption

# This configuration defines a single mixture component (the list for alphas has one element).

tok_rgb@224:
  # Always provide tok_rgb@224 as input.
  input_alphas: [1000.0]
  # Never expect tok_rgb@224 as a target (it's the starting point).
  target_alphas: [0.0]

tok_depth@224:
  # Never provide tok_depth@224 as input during this evaluation.
  input_alphas: [0.0]
  # Always expect tok_depth@224 as a target to be generated.
  target_alphas: [1000.0]

tok_semseg_n5k@224:
  # Never provide tok_semseg_n5k@224 as input during this evaluation.
  input_alphas: [0.0]
  # Always expect tok_semseg_n5k@224 as a target to be generated.
  target_alphas: [1000.0]

caption:
  # Never provide caption as input during this evaluation.
  input_alphas: [0.0]
  # Always expect the full caption as a target to be generated.
  target_alphas: [1000.0]
  # 'full': The model is expected to generate the entire caption sequence.
  # 'random' could be used if evaluating completion of partial captions, but 'full' is typical for generation.
  keep: ['full']

# Notes on alpha values for this eval file:
# - 1000.0: Practically guarantees the modality is used as specified (input or target).
# - 0.0: Practically guarantees the modality is NOT used as specified.
# This setup ensures a deterministic input/output configuration for pipeline evaluation.
